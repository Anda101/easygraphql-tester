  Welcome to easygraphql-tester!

  Check the folder __tests__ to see some examples of how the tests are made... 
  there are examples, with Queries, Mutations and Mocks... with the Mocks 
  you can use something like Chai to check if the mocked result returs the 
  expected data. Visit https://github.com/EasyGraphQL/easygraphql-tester to find all the
  documentation of easygraphql-tester.
